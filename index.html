    <h2>(work in progress!)</h2>
    <p>
        I'm sure the passionate end of congress speech by sva touched us all, and led to many good intentions for things to do. But like many, I wondered what exactly I can or should do. So I figured I'd put together a website so we can figure this out together.

    <p>
        So, please tu wat (do something) and contribute to this database of specific things one can do. The idea is that anyone can come to this website and use this resource to find out what they can do to help fight censorship, to fight for net neutrality, to fight for what the CCC stands for.

        Please contribute what you can. Make sure the information is accurate and as complete as is necessary. The idea is that someone who never helped with this can hit the ground running. Examples are helpful, guides are helpful, reports of successful projects are awesome (they don't have to have originated here)
